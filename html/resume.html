                        <p class="subresume">As a member of the BYU Real Estate Associatoin (BREA) I had the opportunity to visit and learn from CRE Professionals along the Wasatch front from Salt Lake City to Lehi. I was able to learn what they thought about the future of asset types including office, retail, multi-family, and self storage in the area.</p>
                        <p>I most recently worked for an Insurance company on the underwriting team as a property inspector. This was a beneficial experience because I became familiar with the aspects of risk for a wide variety of property types ranging from residential single family to restaurants to multi-family apartments.</p>
                        <p>I’m from Salt Lake City and currently a Finance major in the Marriot School of Business at Brigham Young University. I’ve had an excitement for building and fixing things since a young age. At fifteen I purchased my first car which did not have a working engine. I learned how to do the research necessary to be able to replace it in my own driveway. The following year I built my first framed building by taking advantage of the mentors I knew had worked in construction in my neighborhood. In high school I had the opportunity to be nominated and elected as CEO of our entrepreneurship class company. I was able to help lead our class in developing and implementing a business plan that resulted in our successful profit generation of over $2,000 for charity in just six weeks. I also served as a missionary for my church in Chile. For 6 months of that experience, I was in charge of procuring visas for 150+ missionaries as well as overseeing the maintenance and rental contracts of the housing of those same missionaries. As a result of my efforts, we were able to allow those missionaries to fulfill their purposes there with minimum distraction. They were also able to leave the country without hindrance when they were evacuated due to the COVID-19 emergency. Most recently I was a property inspector for United Insurance Group where I was responsible for coordinating and fulfilling the logistics of commercial and residential inspections in three different counties. The projects I’ve taken on have given me the know how to be able to research problems I don’t know how to solve, lead a group of my peers in planning and successful implementation of those plans, and the ability to organize myself and be a self-starter.</p>
